# GLMDatabase 


**grocery list managment ** this is part of an android group app (Grocery Litst). Only the database part that I have implemented is shown here, so I wont show others work and not to take credit for it. I have implemented the database for this app with sqlite, it first builds the database. As well as basic operations, adds categories, items, deletes items, modifies them and rerturns lists.
